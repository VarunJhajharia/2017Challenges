This program determines the number of possible paths to traverse a matrix.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are going to do this assuming,
a. The coordinates begin at the bottom left of the matrix (0,0)
b. The coordinates end at the top right of the matrix (n,n).
This program will find all possible paths through the matrix, considering you may only move UP or to the RIGHT.
The program will take one arguement from standard input, the size of the matrix.
This will be a single number that will denote a n x n matrix.
A program like this will have an enormous time complexity so please don't try matrices larger than N = 15.
